# Quantum Random Number Generator

## Background
So, as you've probably realized by now, qubits have a potential to be very effective at being random. By leveraging the probabilistic nature of qubits, we could develop a kind of efficient and reliable random number generator without having to depend on the deterministic nature of pseudo-random number generating algorithms that use predictable seeds. 

The approach taken here is with a generalized $W_n$ state, with each bit corresponding to each number in the range from $1 - n$. 

To run, just open the jupyter notebook and hit "run all." The mathematical explanations are stored in the Paper folder, within the pdf file.
